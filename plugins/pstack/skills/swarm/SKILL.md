# Swarm

Fan out N parallel cloud workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not the cloud concurrency limit.
4. Pick the worker profile from `swarm workers` in `~/.devin/rules/pstack-models.md` when present. Otherwise use `pstack:worker`. For a model race, name each arm's profile up front.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes.

## Phase B: Fan out

Launch all N workers as Devin cloud sessions in one pass, via `/handoff` or the v3 sessions API. Plugin `pstack:*` profiles are local-only, so cloud fan-out carries intent in the prompt, not a profile. Use local `run_subagent` workers (`is_background: true`, the configured profile) only when a worker needs access to something on the user's computer.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, set the session's base branch.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.

PORT-NOTE: Devin cloud sessions take a prompt and base branch but no per-spawn profile, so model races and the `swarm workers` profile pin only apply to local `run_subagent` fan-out. A model race in the cloud degrades to same-model arms differentiated by prompt.
